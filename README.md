angular-starter
====

Sometimes I don't feel like `mkdir` and `touch`. Static template for client-only angular apps. Run in the browser with `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `$ http-server` if you have it installed globally (`$ npm install -g http-server`).

# angular-starter

> A static angular.js starter template

## Usage

This project loads in dependencies via CDN. There is no build system. If you have an idea and want to write a quick angular app without a server, this is the project for you.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jasonshark/angular-starter.git
cd angular-starter
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

This starts the website on **http://localhost:8080**
